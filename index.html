<h1>How Unity chose money <br>over their community</h1>

</section>

<section class="info">
<p>
    On September 12 2023 the real-time development platform Unity announced run time fees for their clients many that are small Indy game companies. This was going to implement a $0.20 charge per install of the game. The CEO John Riccitiello (now former CEO) who has implemented some of the worst features in gaming such as the battle pass (which you need to buy a pass to get content for the game which you have already bought). He was also a part of the team that created and implemented loot boxes (a random chance box to get a cosmetic or item from the game usually has some sort of exclusive item with a very low drop rate). He has also publicly insulted game developers for not wanting to introduce microtransactions into games. With him running Unity its no wonder he took a break from trying to squeeze every dime out of players to do the same thing to the actual game studios. If this had gone through it would have changed everything about gaming. There were people online talking about causing companies to go bankrupt with this implementation.  Luckily the community was loud enough to stop this from being implemented, not only that but the outrage hurt Unity as a brand and a lot of game developers wont be soon to forget this and take their games to other engines.

<h3>What the changes would have meant</h3>
<p class="white-background">There is a phenomenon online that the more toxic side of the internet take a part of called review bombing. This is when a large group online spam negative review on something. If runtime fees were implemented people could spam install games causing company's to be forced into bankruptcy  </p>
<p class="white-background"> The free to play game model would no longer be a viable as the game company's would not receive and money for their game but still need to pay for each install. </p>
<p class="white-background">Game demos would also be charged the $0.20 so trying a game before you spend the money on games would no longer be viable because it would cost the companies money for each demo that people install. </p>

</section>  
<section class="text">  <p>With this model bigger companies could use their resources to destroy their smaller competition in the name of competition and their is nothing that the smaller companies can do about it because they lack the resources to pay the install fees.</p></section>
